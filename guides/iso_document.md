#### **Introduction: The Mandate for Precision**

International Standards from ISO/IEC require precise, unambiguous language to ensure uniform global
interpretation. This linguistic discipline is mandated by the _ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2_. The
rules outlined herein are not stylistic suggestions but are essential for creating clear,
verifiable, and legally significant technical documents. The primary goal is to eliminate ambiguity
so that every user understands and implements the standard in exactly the same way.

#### **Section 1: The Core Principles of ISO Style**

- **Clarity, Precision, and Unambiguity:** This is the cardinal rule. Use simple, direct language
  and short sentences. For complex topics, use itemized lists instead of long, convoluted sentences.

- **Objectivity and Factual Tone:** Present only verifiable information. Avoid subjective or
  opinion-based phrasing such as "we feel," "it is believed," or "in our opinion." The tone must be
  impersonal and professional.

- **Consistency:**

    - **Terminology:** A specific concept **shall** always be designated by the same term throughout
      a document. The use of synonyms for stylistic variation is prohibited.

    - **Structure:** A common structure for technical content is highly encouraged, particularly
      within a series of related standards, to aid user comprehension.

- **Inclusive Terminology:** Use language that is welcoming and respectful to all individuals.
  Update archaic or non-inclusive terms during document revisions.


#### **Section 2: Mastering Verbal Forms for Provisions**

The precise use of modal auxiliary verbs is the most critical aspect of ISO sentence formulation.
Each verb has a specific, defined meaning that is not interchangeable.

- "Shall": The Language of Mandatory Requirements

    Used to indicate a requirement that is mandatory for conformance. Failure to implement a "shall"
    statement constitutes a non-conformance.

    Example: "The system shall provide a user interface."

- "Should": The Language of Recommendations

    Used to indicate a recommended course of action or best practice. Non-compliance is permissible
    if an alternative approach is justified; an auditor cannot write a non-conformance against a
    "should" statement.

    Example: "The software should be adaptable across multiple platforms."

- "May": The Language of Permission

    Used to indicate that an action or option is permitted but is neither required nor recommended.
    It grants flexibility to the implementer.

    Example: "The user may select an alternative format."

- "Can": The Language of Possibility and Capability

    Used to make statements of fact about what is possible or what a system is capable of doing. It
    does not express a requirement, recommendation, or permission.

    Example: "The system can process 1,000 transactions per second."


**Summary of Verbal Forms**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Verbal Form**|**Meaning**|**Implication for Compliance**|
|**Shall**|Requirement|Mandatory and auditable. Non-compliance is a failure to conform.|
|**Should**|Recommendation|Not mandatory. Represents best practice.|
|**May**|Permission|Optional. Grants permission for an action or choice.|
|**Can**|Possibility / Capability|Statement of fact. Describes an ability or potential.|

#### **Section 3: The Anatomy of a Requirement**

- **The Imperative of Verifiability:** A requirement **shall** be verifiable, meaning it can be
  tested or measured to confirm it has been met.

    - _Vague:_ "The system should be user-friendly."

    - _Verifiable:_ "The system **shall** allow a new user to complete Task Y in less than five
      minutes."

- **Prioritizing Active Voice:** Write requirements in the active voice. This makes sentences more
  direct and clearly identifies the subject responsible for the action.

    - _Passive:_ "A record of the training **shall** be maintained."

    - _Active:_ "The Human Resources department **shall** maintain a record of the training."

- **Structuring Complex Requirements:** Use an introductory sentence followed by a subordinate list
  to break down requirements with multiple conditions.

    - _Poor:_ "The policy **shall** address user registration, access management, and periodic
      reviews."

    - _Improved:_ "The policy **shall** address the following: a) user registration; b) access
      management; c) periodic reviews."


#### **Section 4: Crafting Definitions**

Clause 3, "Terms and definitions," is the authoritative glossary and is governed by strict rules.

- **No Requirements in Definitions:** A definition **shall not** contain a requirement,
  recommendation, or permission. Definitions describe what something _is_, while requirements
  dictate what something _shall do_.

- **The Substitution Test:** A well-formed definition should be able to replace the term it defines
  within a sentence without altering its meaning or grammatical correctness.

- **Supplementary Information:** Use "Note # to entry," "EXAMPLE," or "Source" in their specified
  formats to add supplementary information after a definition.


#### **Section 5: Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Common Error Type**|**Non-Compliant Example**|**Corrected ISO-Compliant Sentence**|
|**Ambiguous Language**|The software **shall** be easy to use.|The software **shall** enable a user to complete Task Y in under three minutes.|
|**Over-Specification**|The system **shall** use a 256-bit AES algorithm.|The system **shall** encrypt user data in accordance with recognized cryptographic standards.|
|**Incorrect Legal Reference**|The facility **shall** comply with OSHA Standard X.|The organization **shall** identify and have access to applicable legal requirements.|

#### **Conclusion**

Formulating sentences in an ISO standard is a discipline governed by the precise rules of the
_ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2_. The principles of clarity, objectivity, and consistency, combined with
the mastery of verbal forms ("shall," "should," "may," "can") and the structure of verifiable
requirements, are essential for creating an unambiguous and auditable International Standard.
